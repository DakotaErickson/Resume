                        I accepted a position as a full stack software engineer at NetApp after graduating college. I
                        worked
                        primarily in Python (Flask) for the back end, and Typescript (Angular) for the front end. I got
                        exposure to a lot of different technologies during my time at NetApp and I worked as a part of
                        an
                        amazing team. We were constantly dealing with shifting priorities and always managed to deliver
                        on
                        what was requested of us.

                        During my last year of college I began working as a software contractor at NetApp on behalf of
                        Ennovar. I was given a number of different projects to work on throughout the year and I learned
                        a
                        lot. I had great mentorship and was given a lot of autonomy in solving the problems that were
                        given
                        to me. This was my first experience programming professionally and I loved it right away.

                        During my last two years of college I worked as a support contractor at Textron on behalf of
                        Ennovar. I was a part of the initial team that ran Textron's walk-in help center called the Help
                        Hangar. Employees with hardware or software issues could walk in and get help in what was making
                        them unable to do their jobs. We were very successful and I was able to help train the new team
                        members that were brought on as a result.

                        I created a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) blog website that allows a user to perform every
                        action one would expect of such a site. I built this as an opportunity to learn how to work with
                        a database and handle user registration/authentication. A user can create a new post,
                        edit/delete their previous posts, and view all other posts. Users are blocked from
                        editting/deleting posts that they didn't create.
